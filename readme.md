## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd recklion-truffle-lab0
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Install Truffle globally** (if not already installed)

   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

4. **Install Ganache CLI** (optional, for command-line blockchain)
   ```bash
   npm install -g ganache-cli
   ```

### Quick Start

1. **Start your local blockchain**

   - Using Ganache GUI: Launch the Ganache application
   - Using Ganache CLI:
     ```bash
     ganache-cli
     ```

2. **Compile contracts**

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

3. **Deploy contracts**

   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

4. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   truffle test
   ```

5. **Interact with contracts**
   ```bash
   truffle console
   ```

## 🧪 What You'll Learn
